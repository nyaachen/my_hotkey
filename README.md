# my_hotkey

Here is my hotkey code.
All script notifications are in Chinese. Simply edit it if you need English version.

# How to use it

You need to install AutoHotKey program.
If you convert it to executable files it can be used without AutoHotKey program. I will not provide the binary as it may get infected easily.

## Ctrl-Z Warning

This will simply block Ctrl-Z in Windows Explorer to avoid unintended behaviours when you want to undo a Move but actually Windows Explorer just delete the file without any method to recover it.  
Not originally written by me. I extend the feature so it can warn about an unintended Undo in other programs, too.

## Windows-Always-On-Top

This script extends the example in AutoHotKey tutorial.
Press Ctrl-Alt-Up to pin a window and Ctrl-Alt-Down to unpin.

## CopyRights

Some are made by myself, and some are referenced from others' code.
